# Overview
[TonY](https://github.com/linkedin/TonY/) is an open source project that TonY
is a framework to natively run deep learning frameworks on Apache Hadoop.
As Submarine supports multiple runtimes, this module serves as an adaptor so
 that Submarine could leverage TonY as a Runtime implementation to run
TensorFlow with 2.x version of Hadoop and Hadoop installations w/o docker
support or native service. 

Please jump to [QuickStart](src/site/markdown/QuickStart.md) to understand how
to run Submarine with TonY runtime.
