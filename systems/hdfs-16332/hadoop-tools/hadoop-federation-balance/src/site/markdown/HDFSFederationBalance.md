HDFS Federation Balance Guide
=====================

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=0|toDepth=3} -->

Overview
--------

  HDFS Federation Balance is a tool balancing data across different federation
  namespaces. It uses [DistCp](../hadoop-distcp/DistCp.html) to copy data from
  the source path to the target path. First it creates a snapshot at the source
  path and submits the initial distcp. Second it uses distcp diff to do the
  incremental copy until the source and the target are the same. Then If it's
  working in RBF mode it updates the mount table in Router. Finally it moves the
  source to trash.

  This document aims to describe the usage and design of the HDFS Federation
  Balance.

Usage
-----

### Basic Usage

  The hdfs federation balance tool supports both normal federation cluster and
  router-based federation cluster. Taking rbf for example. Supposing we have a
  mount entry in Router:

    Source       Destination
    /foo/src     hdfs://namespace-0/foo/src

  The command below runs an hdfs federation balance job. The first parameter is
  the mount entry. The second one is the target path which must include the
  target cluster.

    bash$ /bin/hadoop rbfbalance -router submit /foo/src hdfs://namespace-1/foo/dst

  It copies data from hdfs://namespace-0/foo/src to hdfs://namespace-1/foo/dst
  incrementally and finally updates the mount entry to:

    Source       Destination
    /foo/src     hdfs://namespace-1/foo/dst

  If the hadoop shell process exits unexpectedly, we can use the command below
  to continue the unfinished job:

    bash$ /bin/hadoop rbfbalance continue

  This will scan the journal to find all the unfinished jobs, recover and
  continue to execute them.

  If we want to balance in a normal federation cluster, use the command below.

    bash$ /bin/hadoop fedbalance submit hdfs://namespace-0/foo/src hdfs://namespace-1/foo/dst

  In normal federation mode the source path must includes the path schema.

### RBF Mode And Normal Federation Mode

  The hdfs federation balance tool has 2 modes:

  * the router-based federation mode (RBF mode).
  * the normal federation mode.

  The command `rbfbalance` runs in router-based federation mode. The command
  `fedbalance` runs in normal federation mode.

  In the rbf mode the first parameter is taken as the mount point. It disables
  write by setting the mount point readonly.

  In the normal federation mode the first parameter is taken as the full path of
  the source. The first parameter must include the source cluster. It disables
  write by cancelling all the permissions of the source path.

  Details about disabling write see [HDFS FedBalance](#HDFS_FedBalance).

### Command Options

Command `submit` has 4 options:

| Option key                     | Description                          | Default |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| -forceCloseOpen | Force close all open files when there is no diff in the DIFF_DISTCP stage. | Wait until there is no open files. |
| -map | Max number of concurrent maps to use for copy. | 10 |
| -bandwidth | Specify bandwidth per map in MB. | 10 |
| -delay | Specify the delayed duration(millie seconds) when the job needs to retry. | 1000 |
| -moveToTrash | This options has 3 values: `trash` (move the source path to trash), `delete` (delete the source path directly) and `skip` (skip both trash and deletion). By default the server side trash interval is used. If the trash is disabled in the server side, the default trash interval 60 minutes is used. | trash |
| -diffThreshold | Specify the threshold of the diff entries that used in incremental copy stage. If the diff entries size is no greater than the threshold and the open files check is satisfied(no open files or force close all open files), the fedBalance will go to the final round of distcp. Setting to 0 means waiting until there is no diff.| 0 |

### Configuration Options
--------------------

Set configuration options at hdfs-fedbalance-site.xml.

| Configuration key              | Description                          | Default |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------- |
| hdfs.fedbalance.procedure.work.thread.num | The worker threads number of the BalanceProcedureScheduler. BalanceProcedureScheduler is responsible for scheduling a balance job, including submit, run, delay and recover. | 10 |
| hdfs.fedbalance.procedure.scheduler.journal.uri | The uri of the journal, the journal file is used for handling the job persistence and recover. | hdfs://localhost:8020/tmp/procedure |

Architecture of HDFS Federation Balance
----------------------

  The components of the HDFS Federation Balance can be classified into the
  following categories:

  * Balance Procedure Scheduler
  * HDFS FedBalance

### Balance Procedure Scheduler

  The Balance Procedure Scheduler implements a state machine. It's responsible
  for scheduling a balance job, including submit, run, delay and recover.
  The model is showed below:

  ![Balance Procedure Scheduler](images/BalanceProcedureScheduler.png)

  * After a job is submitted, the job is added to the pendingQueue.
  * The worker threads take jobs and run them. Journals are written to storage.
  * If writing the journal fails, the job is added to the recoverQueue for later
    recovery. If Worker thread catches a RetryTaskException, it adds the job to
    the delayQueue.
  * Rooster thread takes job from delayQueue and adds it back to pendingQueue.
  * When a scheduler starts, it scans all the unfinished jobs from the journal
    and add them to the recoverQueue. The recover thread will recover them from
    the journal and add them back to the pendingQueue.

### HDFS FedBalance

  HDFS FedBalance is implemented as a job of the state machine. All the distcp
  balance logic are implemented here. An HDFS FedBalance job consists of 3
  procedures:

  * DistCpProcedure: This is the first procedure. It handles all the data copy
    works. There are 6 stages:
    * PRE_CHECK: Do the pre-check of the src and dst path.
    * INIT_DISTCP: Create a snapshot of the source path and distcp it to the
      target.
    * DIFF_DISTCP: Submit distcp with `-diff` round by round to sync source and
      target paths. If `-forceCloseOpen` is set, this stage will finish when
      there is no diff between src and dst. Otherwise this stage only finishes
      when there is no diff and no open files.
    * DISABLE_WRITE: Disable write operations so the src won't be changed. When
      working in router mode, it is done by making the mount point readonly.
      In normal federation mode it is done by cancelling all the permissions of
      the source path.
    * FINAL_DISTCP: Force close all the open files and submit the final distcp.
    * FINISH: Do the cleanup works. In normal federation mode the finish stage
      also restores the permission of the dst path.

  * MountTableProcedure: This procedure updates the mount entry in Router. The
    readonly is unset and the destination is updated of the mount point. This
    procedure is activated only in router based federation mode.

  * TrashProcedure: This procedure moves the source path to trash.

  After all 3 procedures finish, the balance job is done.
